Release notes for GStreamer libav Plugins 1.5.91


The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release candidate for the
stable 1.6 release series. The 1.6 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The final 1.6.0 release is planned
in the next few days unless any major bugs are found.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately by
the GStreamer project.



This module contains plugins based on the libav project, including codecs.



Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
